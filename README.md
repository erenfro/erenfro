- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on chezmoi and fish.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fish shell, chezmoi, micro editor, kubernetes, and nomad.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my website, https://linux-help.org/
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux, I've been using Linux for over 30 years and know quite a bit.
  - Xfce is my primary Desktop Environment. Previously have used GNOME since 2016, and KDE for 20 years. Right now, Wayland is being pushed incredibly hard while supporting apps for it just aren't ready for it, so Xfce is my stable base until things are managable again.
  - My main text editors of choice are micro, neovim, sublime text, xed, and vscode depending on usage.
