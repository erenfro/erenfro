- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on my website, https://linux-help.org/

  - KDE Plasma is my primary Desktop Environment. Previously have used GNOME for 6 years, KDE for 20 years, and always keeping Xfce in the mix.
  - Right now, with Wayland being pushed incredibly hard while supporting apps for it just aren't ready for it, Xfce will always remain at least in back pocket as my stable base.
  - My main text editors of choice are neovim, micro, kate/kwrite, sublime text, and vscode depending on usage.
