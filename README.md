- 🔭 I'm currently working on yadm and bash.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning nomad.
- 🤝🏻 I'm an active community supporter for Linux for various distributions.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on my website, https://linux-help.org/
- 💬 Ask me about Linux, I've been using Linux for over 30 years and know quite a bit.
  - Linux Mint is my primary distribution for Desktop/Laptop use. Debian for servers. With that, I use and recommend [Pacstall](https://pacstall.dev/) for custom package management and updates for improving life where needed in these distributions.
  - Cinnamon is my primary Desktop Environment. Previously have used GNOME for 6 years, KDE for 20 years, and always keeping Xfce in the mix.
  - Right now, with Wayland being pushed incredibly hard while supporting apps for it just aren't ready for it, Xfce will always remain at least in back pocket as my stable base.
  - My main text editors of choice are neovim, micro, xed, sublime text, and vscodium depending on usage.
